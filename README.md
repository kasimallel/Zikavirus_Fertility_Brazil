Introduction: The increase in microcephaly associated with the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil (November 2014) led the 
government to declare a Public Health Emergency and recommend postponing pregnancy. However, the association between ZIKV 
occurrence in this period and fertility rates has not been well studied. Methods: We analyzed a prospective cohort of 1,498 women 
between 15 and 39 years of age living in arbovirus-endemic areas in Fortaleza, Brazil. We explored socioeconomic, demographic, 
behavioral, sexual, reproductive and health-related characteristics. Women were enrolled in February 2018 and followed up twice 
at 6-month intervals. We estimated the total fertility rate (TFR), age-specific fertility rate (ASFR), and mean age at first birth 
(MAB) and used a multivariate Poisson regression model to explore the main factors associated with fertility. 
Results: TFR was lowest during the epidemic period (2.64, 95% CI: 2.06, 3.06), increasing in the post-epidemic phase 
(TFR=3.52, 95% CI: 3.18, 3.86). Low educational attainment (RR=1.32, TFR=3.69, 95% CI:3.26, 4.13), overcrowding 
(RR=1.27, TFR=3.26, 95% CI 2.98, 3.54), and having undergone an abortion (RR=1.85, TFR=4.88, 95% CI:4.31, 5.45) were associated 
with higher fertility rates. Conversely, having had an unwanted pregnancy was associated with reduced fertility 
(RR=0.81, TFR=2.65, 95% CI: 2.41, 2.89). Conclusion: We observed a slowdown in fertility rates during the epidemic period coincident 
with human ZIKV transmission with large differences by sociodemographic gradients, especially for educational attainment. 
Health policies oriented to reproductive health should be re- evaluated to ensure wider access and information on reproductive health 
including decriminalization of abortion policies.
